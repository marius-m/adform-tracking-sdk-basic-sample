# Sample app for AdformTrackingSDK

This is a basic sample app how to integrate AdformTrackingSDK. It&rsquo;s a good idea
to follow [documentation](https://github.com/adform/adform-tracking-android-sdk) when implementing it.


# Troubleshooting

-   After integration, to check if events are being sent, open logcat to check events like in screenshot
-   Events are not sent instantly, so it may take a couple of minutes to see events
